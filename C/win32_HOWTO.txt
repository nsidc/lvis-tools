The source code for the 'lvis_release_reader' is very basic C code, and should compile on just about any compiler.

Here are some steps to compile it for a windows platform:

1) download / obtain a free compiler (LCC is a great one)

http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/

current direct link:  ftp://ftp.cs.virginia.edu/pub/lcc-win32/lccwin32.exe

2) install it on your machine (run the lccwin32.exe program and install on your machine)

Just accept all the defaults if you're not sure.

3) download and uncompress the lvis_release_reader which you can obtain from http://lvis.gsfc.nasa.gov

for this example, I put the files in C:\LVIS

4) create a new project in LCC and add the release reader source code

Click to:
Start -> Programs -> lcc-win32 -> lcc-win32

In the wedit program (lcc's editor) click to:
Project -> Create

Now, enter a project name and where the home of the project is.
For this example, I used lvisreader as my project name and C:\LVIS for both source and object directories.
And make sure 'Console Application' is toggled (should be by default)
Click 'Create'

Click 'NO' to using the application skeletonl.

Add the source code to the project:
Just click on the lvis_release_reader.c and OK

Click NEXT through all the defaults (or you can change things if you like)

5) Compile our program:

In the wedit program, click to:
Compiler -> Make  (or you can just hit F9)

That's it, you should have a lvisreader.exe in C:\LVIS now

I would rename the .LGE, .LCE or .LGW file to something easier to type because you have to run this from the console.

For example, as a test, I'm looking at some Panama data and I'm going to rename it to something short:

rename LVIS_CR_1998_VECT_20060123_Barro_Colorado_Island.lge to bcdata.lge

Load up the console:
Start -> Programs -> Accessories -> Command Prompt

Then in the console, I can just type:

cd c:\lvis
lvisreader bcdata.lge > bcdata.txt


and you have ASCII data from the binary distribution file.
